										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Your Question:</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;<em>How am I supposed to start a career in animations? I am confused about the softwares to learn. Blender vs Maya and blah blah. Please guide me.</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block"><strong>My Answer:</strong></p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">Hi, It&#8217;s very good that you think about that and you plan for what you want to do.</p>
<p><span id="more-1"></span></p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">Yes there are many software and in fact software is just one aspect of it.</p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">The process of finding the answer might take several months for you, but the magic will happen if you just research, write and think about it 20 minutes  each day </p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">My recommendation is two steps</p>
<ol>
<li>bring a notebook and write in it your goals in 1 month, 1 year, 5 year, 10 year Do you want to be an employee? freelance or make your own movies? do you want to be in process of production of an animated film? or motion graphics or ads? do you want to produce short animated films or long ones?</li>
<li>research about
<ol>
<li>different careers in animation studios, media production studios, Ads agencies.</li>
<li>workflow of animation production / production pipeline</li>
<li>famous films, ads, motion graphics, number of staff and years they took to produce </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">Then based on these answers if you want to be “animator” you can choose what software to learn, if you want to be “modeler” the story differs , if you want to be compositor , that differs. If you want to be a freelancer or a single person making short films for festivals that also differ, and many much more other paths. But based on 1 and 2 you can answer them.</p>
<p class="q-text qu-display--block">Wish you success</p>
